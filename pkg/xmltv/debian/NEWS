xmltv (0.5.69-1) unstable; urgency=medium

   Important notice for users of the tv_grab_uk_rt/uk_atlas grabbers:

   The tv_grab_uk_rt and tv_grab_uk_atlas grabbers are no longer provided.
   UK/Eire users wishing to receive rich TV listings data are recommended to
   migrate to the new tv_grab_zz_sdjson and tv_grab_zz_sdjson_sqlite grabbers.
   Note that both grabbers require a subscription to the Schedules Direct
   service.

   Important notice for users of the tv_grab_sd_json grabber:

   The existing tv_grab_sd_json grabber will be renamed to tv_grab_zz_sdjson
   in the next release of XMLTV, to reflect its worldwide listings support.
   This release of XMLTV provides scripts with both names. Existing users of
   the tv_grab_sd_json grabber are recommended to migrate to the "new"
   tv_grab_zz_sdjson grabber as soon as possible (either by renaming the
   config file or configuring the grabber from scratch).
