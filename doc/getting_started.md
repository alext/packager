Getting started
---------------

First, start the ubuntu package builder VM:

    $ vagrant up

Follow the instructions it gives you for setting up your environment. Then,
logged into the box, you should be able to make source packages by running
`build_source.py <target>` in the `packager` directory. You will be prompted
to sign the source packages with your GPG key.

    $ cd ~/packager
    $ ./build_source.py pkg/collectd

To test a binary package build, you first need to set up sbuild:

    $ ./tools/sbuildinit  # follow the instructions about restarting your shell
    $ ./tools/sbuildinit

You can then build binary packages from .dsc files:

    $ sbuild -A -d precise-amd64 build/collectd/collectd_5.3.0-ppa4.dsc

For understanding the folder structure for packager packages: [here](folder_structure.md)

Building packages for multiple series
-------------------------------------

Building packages for multiple series ("Precise", "Trusty", etc.) is slightly
more involved. See [`building_for_multiple_series.md`](building_for_multiple_series.md).

Submitting to Launchpad
-----------------------

Once you've verified that you're able to build a .deb from your .dsc, you can
submit the original .changes file to Launchpad for building:

    $ dput ppa:gds/govuk build/collectd/collectd_5.3.0-ppa4_source.changes

Common error encountered during upload: [here](https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/UploadErrors)

Once you are able to upload the changes file, you would get an email for either your
upload has been accepted or rejected on the basis of launchpad criteria
(also stated in the common errors links)
